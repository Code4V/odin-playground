I'm into building and programming web applications and websites, and I can see myself doing this for a pretty long time. \n\n Another thing that I'm into is teaching people on the basics of coding and assisting as much as I can. Because, I believe that everyone should at least learn the basics of coding for it will surely help them along their professional career."
